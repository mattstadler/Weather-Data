# Weather-Data

## Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to efficiently analyze weather data to inform a surf shop investment decision. Specifically, temperature data from June and December are used to determine whether opening a surf shop is a good idea. 

## Results
- June temperatures are on average ~4 degrees higher than December temperatures
- There is a wider spread of temperatures in December
- While June temperatures are generally warmer than December temperatures, the differences are probably negligible, with the 25-75% range in June of 76 - 80 degrees and the same range in December of 70 - 77 degrees

## Summary
- Overall, it appears the weather differences between June and December aren't too drastic, and both support surfing. Additional data could be gathered to look at levels of precipitation and also levels of tourism throughout the year. Both of these factors would likely impact foot traffic by a surf shop and in turn sales.
